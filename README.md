#### Description

Realistic diffraction is an implementation of the paper *Practical Acquisition and Rendering of Diffraction Effects in Surface Reflectance. Antoine Toisoul and Abhijeet Ghosh. ACM Transactions on Graphics, 2017.* 
It allows : 
* the computation of diffraction lookup tables given the HDR photograph of a diffraction pattern measured with a spectral filter
* the prefiltering of an environment map with a diffraction lookup table for real-time rendering of diffraction effects in arbitrary environments

The software requires OpenCV and has been tested with OpenCV 2.4.11.

A video of the renderings is available [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DNOej4KgtJY)

#### Usage

An example of how to compute a diffraction lookup table and the convolution are given in `main.cpp`. The function that computes the lookup table is given in `huygens.cpp`. The function that computes the prefiltering is given in `convolution.cpp`.
